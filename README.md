### Job listings with filtering

> This is not a big project that uses react 
> together with the Redux library. The project 
> implements card filtering through Redux and 
> this is the main goal of the project, to learn 
> how Redux works and use it as a storage of 
> some logic and data.

*Libraries that are used in the project:*
```
"dependencies": {
    "react": "17.0.2",
